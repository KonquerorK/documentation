Manage a bank in a foreign currency
===================================

In Odoo, every transaction is recorded in the default currency of the company. Reports are all based
on the currency of the company. For transactions occurring in another currency, Odoo stores both the
value in the currency of the company and the value in the currency of the transaction.

When you have a bank account in a foreign currencies, for every transaction, Odoo stores two values:

-  The debit/credit in the currency of the company;
-  The debit/credit in the currency of the bank account.

Currency rates are updated automatically using the web services of a banking institution. By
default, Odoo uses the European Central Bank's web services but other options are available.

Configuration
=============

Activate the multi-currency feature
-----------------------------------

To work with multiple currencies, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings
--> Currencies` and tick :guilabel:`Multi-Currencies`. Under :guilabel:`Post Exchange difference
entries in:`, provide a :guilabel:`Journal`, a :guilabel:`Gain Account`, a :guilabel:`Loss Account`,
and then click on :guilabel:`Save`.

Configure currencies
--------------------

Once Odoo is configured to support multiple currencies, activate the currencies you plan to work
with. To do that, go into :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Currencies` or in
:guilabel:`Activate Other Currencies` that appears under :guilabel:`Multi-Currencies` once the box
has been checked. All currencies are created by default, but only a few are active from the start.

Once the currencies are activated, you can choose to **automate** the currency rate update, or leave
it on **manual**. To configure the rate update, under the same :guilabel:`Currencies` menu, check
:guilabel:`Automatic Currency Rates` and set :guilabel:`Interval` to your desired frequency. You
also have the option to choose the :guilabel:`Service` you wish to obtain currency rates from.


Click on the Update now button (:guilabel:`ðŸ—˜`) found after the :guilabel:`Next Run` field to update
the currency rates manually.

Create a new bank account
-------------------------

In the accounting application, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals` and
create a new one. Enter a :guilabel:`Journal Name` and set the :guilabel:`Type` to `Bank`. In the
:guilabel:`Journal Entries` tab, enter a **short code**, a **currency**, and then finally click on
the :guilabel:`Bank Account` field to create a new account. In the pop-up window of the account
creation, enter a name, a code (ex.: 550007), set its type to `Bank and Cash`, set a currency type,
and save. When you are back on the **journal**, click on the :guilabel:`Account Number` field, and
in the pop-up window, fill out the :guilabel:`Account Number`, :guilabel:`Bank` of your account, and
save.

found under :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Chart of Accounts`.
