Salary rules

Contracts` and select the contract of the employee. In the :guilabel:`Salary Structure Type` field,
select :guilabel:`UAE Employee`.

   :alt: Select the Salary Structure Type to apply to the contract.

Leave deduction is calculated using a salary rule linked to the unpaid leave time off type, however, any other deduction or reimbursement is done manually using other inputs.

Additionally, overtime is added manually through work entries and finally, Generated from the Salary Attachments Model are the Attachment of Salary, Assignment of Salary, and Child Support.

.. tip::
   If you do not wish a rule to appear on a paycheck. go to :menuselection:`Payroll -->
   Configuration --> Structures`. Click on the **U.A.E. structure**, select the rule to hide, and
   uncheck :guilabel:`Appears on Payslip`.

Also if you go to any contract, under the Salary Information tab, you can find some fields that appear after installing the localization package such as Wage, Housing allowance, Transportation allowance, and Other allowances as well as the Number of days field which is how the end of service provision is calculated:

End of Service Provision
------------------------

The provision is defined as the total monthly allowance *divided* by 30, and then *multiplied* by
the number of days set in the field :guilabel:`Number of days` at the bottom of a contract's form.

The provision is then calculated via a salary rule associated with two accounts: the **End Of
Service Indemnity (Expense account)** and the **End of Service Provision (Non-current Liabilities
account)**. The latter is used to pay off the **End of service** amount by settling it with the
**Payables account**.

.. note::
   The **End of service** calculations are based on the Basic Salary only as to the United Arab Emirates HR laws. The start and end dates of the employeeâ€™s contracts trigger the calculations.

Invoices
--------
Invoices generated with the U.A.E localization installed can be in English, Arabic, or both. It also
includes a line to display the **VAT amount** per line.
